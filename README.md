# Sams-UCB-Refractor

This is my first assignment for the UCB Bootcamp. It is a code refractor of the website for a made-up company called Horiseon. In it, I added semantic elements to an existing HTML document and consolidated CSS styles to make the code easier to read and understand. 

Here is the [link to the website](https://sam-levin.github.io/Sams-UCB-Refractor/)
